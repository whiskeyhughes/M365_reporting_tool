## Name
The Office 365 License Feature Tool!

## Description
Anyone who has worked with Microsoft 365 knows that the licenses and features included in each license tier is very confusing, and often times requires a PHD to properly understand. We wanted a way to break down the different licenses to their simplist properties so that way users could quickly and visually see what is included in the different tiers. This will help our sales team stop underselling or overselling licenses.

## Roadmap

- **Migrating to using API.** We are looking to potentially pull this data from Microsoft's Graph API vs. CSVs

- **Buzzword Catagory.** We are also looking to add a "Buzzwords" option that would help the sales team know what terms are okay to say in client conversations. Ideally you would also be able to search for something like, "Conditional Access" and see what licenses this feature is included in.
